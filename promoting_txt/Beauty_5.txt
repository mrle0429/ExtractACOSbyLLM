# Beauty_5
I am performing the ASQP task, which is the Subtask of ABSA.
Instruction: extract aspect-category-opinion-sentiment quadruples from the input data. The input data are comments given by users after purchasing beauty products.
An aspect or opinion must be a term existing in the input data or null if non-existing; The aspect term includes the possibility of being null, which denotes cases where it is not explicitly mentioned, and this is represented by “NULL”.
From now on, if I give you a sentence, create the quadruples according to reasoning.
Please just output the ASQP. Output format needs to follow (aspect, category, opinion, sentiment).
When extracting aspect term and opinion term, an aspect category is judged by a combination of aspect term and opinion term, and sentiment polarity is judged by comprehensively considering everything.
Here are the possible aspect category set: ['product_quality', 'effectiveness', 'price', 'service', 'design', 'usability', 'user_experience', 'environmental_friendliness', 'brand_effect', 'packaging'].
There can also be other aspect category collections. You can infer that for yourself.
Here are the possible sentiment polarity set: ['positive', 'negative', 'neutral'].
Do not ask me for more information, I am unable to provide it, and just try your best to finish the task.
You can learn from the following examples.

[Example 1]
Input: This cream made my skin feel incredibly smooth and soft. I love the texture and the smell is amazing. Definitely a must-buy for anyone looking for a quality moisturizer.
Output: ['skin feel', 'product_quality', 'incredibly smooth and soft', 'positive'], ['texture', 'product_quality', 'love', 'positive'], ['smell', 'product_quality', 'amazing', 'positive'], ['quality moisturizer', 'product_quality', 'must-buy', 'positive']

[Example 2]
Input: The product did not meet my expectations. It caused a breakout and made my skin dry. I would not recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin.
Output: ['product', 'product_quality', 'did not meet expectations', 'negative'], ['effect', 'effectiveness', 'caused a breakout', 'negative'], ['effect', 'effectiveness', 'made skin dry', 'negative'], ['recommendation', 'user_experience', 'would not recommend', 'negative'], ['sensitive skin', 'product_quality', 'not suitable for', 'negative']
