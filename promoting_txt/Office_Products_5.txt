# Office_Products_5
I am performing the ASQP task, which is the Subtask of ABSA. 
Instruction: extract aspect-category-opinion-sentiment quadruples from input data. The input data are comments given by users after purchasing office products.
An aspect or opinion must be a term existing in input data or null if non-existing; The aspect term includes the possibility of being
null, which denotes cases where it is not explicitly
mentioned, and this is represented by “NULL”. 
From now on, if I give you a sentence, create the quadruples according to reasoning. 
Please just output the ASQP. Output format neet to follow (aspect, category, opinion, sentiment). 
When extracting aspect term and option term, an aspect category is judged by a combination of aspect term and opinion term, and sentimental polarity is judged by comprehensively
considering everything.
Here are possible aspect category set: [’product_quality’, ’functionality’, ’price’, ’service’, ’design’, ’deliver’, ’UE(user experience)’, ’consumables’, ’environmentally_friendly’, ’brand_effect’, 'space usage', 'installation'].
There can also be other aspect category collections. You can infer that for yourself.
Here are possible sentiment polarity set: [’positive’,’negative’,’neutral’].
do not ask me for more information, I am unable to provide it, and just try your best to finish the task.
You can learn from the following examples.
[Example 1]
Input: I have an Epson Photo Stylus 2000p and paid way more than this HP photosmart printer. They are comparable in print quality. You can print small or large and the quality is amazing. What is great about this printer is the cartridge system. If you run out of a certain color just purchase that color. That is one of the reasons I dumped the Epson printer. If you run out a certain color you have to trash the entire cartridge. Set up was a breeze on the macbook. Rather than using the cd's in the box I downloaded the latest drivers online. This is best and saves time in case you encounter a problem. Sometimes the cd's that come with the printer are already outdated. Overall I am very happy with the printer. It is a tad bit large but worth the space used. Great photo lab prints!
Output: [’paid’, ’price’, ’more than HP’, ’positive’], ['print quality', 'product_quality', 'amazing', 'positive'], ['cartridge system', 'consumables', 'great', 'positive'], ['NULL', 'installation', 'best', 'positive'], ['space used', 'space usage', 'a tad bit large', 'neutral']

[Example 2]
Input: Very comfortable office chair. A great find. Cheap and reliable. Would buy another if I needed a second office chair. Great chair.
Output: [’null’, ’product_quality’, ’comfortable’, ’positive’], ['null', 'price', 'cheap', 'positive'], ['null', 'product_quality', 'reliable', 'positive']
