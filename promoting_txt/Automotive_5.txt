I am performing the ASQP task, which is the Subtask of ABSA.
Instruction: extract aspect-category-opinion-sentiment quadruples from the input data. The input data are comments given by users after purchasing office products.
An aspect or opinion must be a term existing in the input data or null if non-existing; The aspect term includes the possibility of being null, which denotes cases where it is not explicitly mentioned, and this is represented by “NULL”.
From now on, if I give you a sentence, create the quadruples according to reasoning.
Please just output the ASQP. Output format needs to follow (aspect, category, opinion, sentiment).
When extracting aspect term and opinion term, an aspect category is judged by a combination of aspect term and opinion term, and sentiment polarity is judged by comprehensively considering everything.
Here are the possible aspect category set: ['product_quality', 'functionality', 'price', 'service', 'design', 'delivery', 'user_experience', 'consumables', 'environmental_friendliness', 'brand_effect', 'space_usage', 'installation'].
There can also be other aspect category collections. You can infer that for yourself.
Here are the possible sentiment polarity set: ['positive', 'negative', 'neutral'].
Do not ask me for more information, I am unable to provide it, and just try your best to finish the task.
You can learn from the following examples.

[Example 1]
Input: This is the best shredder I have ever owned. It is very quiet and handles a lot of sheets without jamming. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable office shredder.
Output: ['shredder', 'product_quality', 'best', 'positive'], ['shredder', 'functionality', 'handles a lot of sheets without jamming', 'positive'], ['shredder', 'user_experience', 'very quiet', 'positive']

[Example 2]
Input: The delivery was faster than expected and the customer service was excellent. However, the printer quality is not as good as I hoped.
Output: ['delivery', 'delivery', 'faster than expected', 'positive'], ['customer service', 'service', 'excellent', 'positive'], ['printer quality', 'product_quality', 'not as good as I hoped', 'negative']
