So that was fun.  It said it would take about a month to arrive and it did take that long.  I was hoping for a more interesting taste but to our family,  it just tasted a bit less flavorful or weaker than the standard milk chocolate kit kat.  The green tea flavor was too subtle for the sugar and it just tasted sweet. The wafers were very crispy, and that was good,  but it tasted a bit anemic to us.I'm happy I bought it, but don't need to buy it again.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "3.5 stars,  sadly not as wonderful as I had hoped", "unixReviewTime": 1400457600, "reviewTime": "05 19, 2014"}
